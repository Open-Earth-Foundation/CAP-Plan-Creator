# Climate Action Implementation Plan

**City:** Caxias do Sul<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

## Main Action Description

### 1. Climate Strategy Overview

Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with sectoral plans for mitigation and adaptation. The strategy is informed by scientific methodologies and aims to optimize resource allocation for maximum mitigation results while promoting socio-economic development [source: Brazil_NDC_November2024.pdf, page 7]. However, specific national strategies related to "Zero Emission Buses" were not found in the retrieved documents.

Local climate strategies for Caxias do Sul or specific strategies related to "Zero Emission Buses" in the city were not available in the retrieved documents.

### 2. Climate Action Description

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative in Caxias do Sul aims to integrate electric or zero-emission technologies into the city's public transportation fleet. This action is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector by 20-39%, improve urban air quality, and promote equity by providing cleaner transit options to underserved communities. The initiative will require significant investment in infrastructure and supportive policies, with a timeline for implementation of less than five years. Key performance indicators include the number of zero-emission buses deployed and improvements in air quality and public ridership levels.

## Climate Risks:

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative primarily focuses on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. It does not directly address specific climate risks (hazards) such as droughts, heatwaves, floods, sea-level rise, landslides, storms, wildfires, or diseases. The primary aim of this action is to reduce emissions and improve urban air quality, contributing to broader climate mitigation goals rather than directly addressing specific climate hazards.

## Mitigation Sectors:

- **Transportation**: The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative directly addresses the transportation sector by integrating electric or zero-emission technologies into the public transportation fleet. This action aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport, specifically targeting on-road public transit systems. By transitioning to zero-emission buses, the initiative contributes to a significant reduction in emissions, estimated between 20-39%, and improves urban air quality.

## Relationship with SGDs:

- **SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being**: The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to improve air quality in urban areas, which directly contributes to better health outcomes and well-being for all residents, particularly in underserved communities.
