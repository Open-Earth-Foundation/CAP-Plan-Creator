# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Camaçari<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Camaçari, located in the state of Bahia, Brazil, is a vibrant city with a population of approximately 300,372 residents. Situated in a tropical rainforest biome, the city faces significant socio-economic challenges, including a very high percentage of low-income residents. The city is also vulnerable to climate-related risks such as heatwaves and flooding, which impact public health and infrastructure.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to integrate electric or other zero-emission technologies into Camaçari's public transportation fleet. This action is crucial for reducing the city's transportation emissions, which currently stand at 295,693,000 metric tons. By transitioning to zero-emission buses, Camaçari can significantly improve air quality, promote equity by providing cleaner air in underserved communities, and create job opportunities in the maintenance and operation of these buses.

This initiative aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes the transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's National Mitigation Strategy supports the electrification of the transportation sector as a key measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable urban development [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 15]. The strategy also highlights the importance of integrating sustainable urban development actions with nature-based solutions to enhance resilience [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 15].

By implementing the Zero Emission Buses initiative, Camaçari not only contributes to national climate goals but also addresses local socio-economic and environmental challenges, fostering a more sustainable and equitable urban environment.

## Subactions:

1. **Set a Target Year for Transition**: Establish a clear target year for transitioning to zero-emission buses to drive action and signal demand to suppliers and capital providers. This will encourage investment in developing zero-emission bus models and technology [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

2. **Conduct Feasibility Studies**: Perform in-depth feasibility studies to explore technology and financing options. This should include an analysis of the local grid capacity and potential infrastructure upgrades needed [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1; zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 7].

3. **Engage Stakeholders**: Collaborate with utility companies, bus manufacturers, and other stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition. This includes negotiating with utility companies to ensure sufficient and reliable power supply for charging infrastructure [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1; zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 7].

4. **Pilot Program Implementation**: Initiate a pilot program to test different zero-emission bus technologies and procurement options, such as outright purchase, lease, or joint purchasing [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 2].

5. **Develop Charging Infrastructure**: Establish charging infrastructure at depots and on-route. Consider options like overnight slow charging at depots and fast on-route charging to extend bus range and flexibility [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 8; electric_vehicle_city_deploying_charging_infrastructure_c40.pdf, page 2].

6. **Secure Public Funding and Incentives**: Work with government bodies to secure public funding or financial incentives for transit agencies to support the transition to zero-emission buses.

7. **Train Workforce**: Develop training programs for the maintenance and operation of zero-emission buses to ensure a skilled workforce is available.

8. **Staggered Introduction of Buses**: Gradually introduce zero-emission buses into the fleet, ensuring infrastructure and operational adjustments are made in tandem [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

9. **Monitor and Evaluate Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of zero-emission buses and charging infrastructure. Use key performance indicators such as reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and operational cost savings to evaluate success.

10. **Promote Public Acceptance**: Implement campaigns to increase public awareness and acceptance of zero-emission buses as a cleaner and more sustainable transportation option.

## Climate Risks:

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative is primarily a mitigation effort aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. While it does not directly address specific climate risks such as heatwaves, floods, or droughts, it contributes to the broader goal of emission reduction and air quality improvement, which can have indirect impacts on climate resilience. Therefore, the initiative primarily targets emission reduction rather than specific climate hazards.

## Mitigation Sectors:

* Transportation: The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative specifically addresses the transportation sector by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into public buses. This transition from traditional fuel-powered buses to zero-emission buses aims to significantly reduce GHG emissions within the city's transportation sector, thus contributing to improved air quality and supporting a more sustainable urban transit system.
