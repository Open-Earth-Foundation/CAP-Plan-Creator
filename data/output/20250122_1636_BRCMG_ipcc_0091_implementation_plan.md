# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**Climate action:** Diversification of livelihoods<br>
**City:** Corumbá

## Main Action Description
### 1. Climate Strategy Overview
Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a focus on sustainable development and socio-economic growth. The strategy includes sectoral plans for land use, forestry, and agriculture, aiming to suppress illegal deforestation and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The strategy also highlights the importance of integrating climate and digital transitions to enhance Brazil's competitiveness in green technologies [source: Brazil_NDC_November2024.pdf, pages 6, 7, 14]. However, specific national strategies related to the diversification of livelihoods were not found. Additionally, no local strategies specific to Corumbá were retrieved.
