## Main Action Description: 
Disaster Early Warning  
Camaçari

### 1. Broad Climate Strategy
Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes a holistic approach to climate change, integrating environmental, economic, and social dimensions. The country aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, supported by the National Adaptation Strategy and sectoral plans that prioritize resilience and sustainable development. The strategy includes specific actions to mitigate climate risks, particularly through early warning systems for disasters, which align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and address vulnerabilities among marginalized communities [source: Brazil NDC, pages 6, 9, 10].

### 2. Climate Action Description
In Camaçari, the Disaster Early Warning initiative will establish and maintain systems to alert residents about heatwaves, droughts, and storms. This action will involve the development of Heat Action Plans (HAPs) that incorporate nature-based solutions, such as green spaces, to enhance urban resilience. The plan will focus on vulnerable populations, ensuring equitable access to resources and information. Key performance indicators will include reduced heatwave-related mortality and increased public awareness. Implementation is expected within five years, requiring coordination among emergency services and community engagement [source: Brazil NDC, pages 7, 14].
