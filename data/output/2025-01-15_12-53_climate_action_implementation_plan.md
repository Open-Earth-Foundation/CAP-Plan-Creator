## Main Action Description: 
Disaster Early Warning  
Camaçari

### 1. Broad Climate Strategy
Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes a holistic approach to climate change, integrating environmental, economic, and social dimensions. The country aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, supported by the National Adaptation Strategy and sectoral plans that prioritize resilience and sustainable development. Camaçari, located in Bahia, aligns with these national goals by focusing on local adaptation measures, including the establishment of early warning systems for climate-related disasters. This initiative is part of Brazil's commitment to enhance community resilience and reduce vulnerabilities, particularly among marginalized groups [source: Brazil NDC, pages 6, 9, 10].

### 2. Climate Action Description
The Disaster Early Warning action in Camaçari involves establishing systems to provide timely alerts for heatwaves, droughts, and storms. This includes the implementation of Heat Action Plans (HAPs) that integrate nature-based solutions, public awareness campaigns, and targeted interventions for vulnerable populations. Key performance indicators will measure the effectiveness of these systems, focusing on reducing heatwave-related mortality and enhancing community preparedness. The initiative aims to improve public health, reduce economic losses, and foster ecosystem benefits through urban green spaces [source: Brazil NDC, page 14].
