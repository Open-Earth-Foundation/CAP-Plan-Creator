### 1. National Climate Strategy
Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, guided by scientific methodologies and data. The strategy includes sectoral plans for mitigation and adaptation, focusing on sustainable development and socio-economic growth. Brazil aims to integrate climate and digital transitions, promoting green technologies and solutions. The strategy also prioritizes actions with co-benefits for adaptation and resilience, such as biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services [source: Brazil_NDC_November2024.pdf, pages 6, 7, 14].
