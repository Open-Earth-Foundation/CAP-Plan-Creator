# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Camaçari<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Camaçari, located in the state of Bahia, Brazil, is a vibrant city with a population of approximately 300,372 residents. Situated in a tropical rainforest biome, the city covers an area of 758.73 square kilometers and is characterized by a high population density of 382.43 people per square kilometer. Camaçari faces significant socio-economic challenges, with a very high percentage of low-income residents and issues related to public health and infrastructure due to climate hazards such as heatwaves and flooding.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to transform Camaçari's public transportation system by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into its bus fleet. This action is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, which currently accounts for a significant portion of the city's total emissions. By promoting cleaner air and sustainable urban transit, the initiative not only addresses environmental concerns but also enhances equity and inclusion by providing reliable and clean transportation options for low-income communities.

This initiative aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes the transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's National Mitigation Strategy focuses on optimizing resource allocation to maximize mitigation results while promoting socio-economic development [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 7]. The strategy also highlights the importance of climate justice, ensuring that vulnerable groups benefit from climate actions [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 22]. The implementation of zero-emission buses in Camaçari supports these national goals by contributing to greenhouse gas reduction and fostering sustainable urban development.

## Subactions:

1. **Set a Target Year for Transition**: Establish a clear target year for the full transition to zero-emission buses. This will help drive city actions and signal demand to bus suppliers, operators, and capital providers, encouraging investment in zero-emission bus models and technology [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

2. **Conduct Feasibility Studies**: Perform in-depth feasibility studies to explore technology and financing options. This should include assessments of available zero-emission bus technologies, such as battery electric and hydrogen buses, and their applicability to Camaçari [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

3. **Engage Stakeholders**: Collaborate with utility companies, bus manufacturers, and other stakeholders to ensure the availability of necessary infrastructure and technology. Early engagement with manufacturers is crucial to understand product availability and secure the necessary technology [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 2].

4. **Pilot Program Implementation**: Initiate a pilot program to test zero-emission buses in selected routes. This will help identify operational challenges and gather data for further scaling [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

5. **Procurement and Financing**: Explore various procurement options such as outright purchase, leasing, or joint purchasing agreements. Secure public funding or financial incentives to support the transition [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 2].

6. **Infrastructure Development**: Invest in necessary infrastructure, including charging stations and maintenance facilities, to support the operation of zero-emission buses. This may require staggered infrastructure upgrades to align with bus deployment [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

7. **Training and Workforce Development**: Develop training programs for drivers and maintenance staff to ensure they are equipped to handle new technologies. This will also create job opportunities in the maintenance and operation of zero-emission buses [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

8. **Performance Monitoring and Analysis**: Continuously monitor the performance of zero-emission buses and infrastructure. Analyze data to ensure a smooth and affordable transition, making adjustments as necessary [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

9. **Public Engagement and Awareness**: Promote public acceptance and demand for cleaner public transportation options through awareness campaigns. Highlight the benefits of zero-emission buses in terms of air quality and equity [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].
