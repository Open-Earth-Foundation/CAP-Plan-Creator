<h1>Climate Action Implementation Plan</h1>
<p><strong>City:</strong> Camaçari<br>
<strong>Climate action:</strong> Zero Emission Buses</p>
<p>Camaçari, located in the state of Bahia, Brazil, is a vibrant city with a population of approximately 300,372 residents. Situated in a tropical rainforest biome, the city covers an area of 758.73 square kilometers and is characterized by a high population density of 382.43 people per square kilometer. Camaçari faces significant socio-economic challenges, with a very high percentage of low-income residents and issues related to public health and infrastructure due to climate hazards such as heatwaves and flooding.</p>
<p>The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to transform Camaçari's public transportation system by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into its bus fleet. This action is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, which currently accounts for a significant portion of the city's total emissions. By promoting cleaner air and sustainable urban transit, the initiative not only addresses environmental concerns but also enhances equity and inclusion by providing reliable and clean transportation options for low-income communities.</p>
<p>This initiative aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes the transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's National Mitigation Strategy focuses on optimizing resource allocation to maximize mitigation results while promoting socio-economic development [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 7]. The strategy also highlights the importance of climate justice, ensuring that vulnerable groups benefit from climate actions [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 22]. The implementation of zero-emission buses in Camaçari supports these national goals by contributing to greenhouse gas reduction and fostering sustainable urban development.</p>
