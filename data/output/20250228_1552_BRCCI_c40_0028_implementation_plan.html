<h1>Climate Action Implementation Plan</h1>
<p><strong>City:</strong> Camaçari<br>
<strong>Climate action:</strong> Zero Emission Buses</p>
<p>Camaçari, located in the state of Bahia, Brazil, is a vibrant city with a population of approximately 300,372 residents. Situated in a tropical rainforest biome, the city covers an area of 758.73 square kilometers and is characterized by a high population density of 382.43 people per square kilometer. Camaçari faces significant socio-economic challenges, with a very high percentage of low-income residents and issues related to inadequate sanitation services.</p>
<p>The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to transform Camaçari's public transportation system by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into its bus fleet. This initiative is crucial for reducing the city's transportation emissions, which currently stand at 295,693,000 metric tons. By promoting cleaner air and sustainable urban transit, the initiative not only addresses environmental concerns but also enhances public health and equity, particularly benefiting underserved communities that are disproportionately affected by air pollution.</p>
<p>This climate action aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes the transition to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's National Mitigation Strategy supports the electrification of the transportation sector, aiming to replace fossil fuels with electricity and biofuels, thereby reducing emissions and promoting sustainable urban development [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 15]. The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative in Camaçari is a vital component of this broader national effort, contributing to the country's commitment to climate justice and sustainable development [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 22].</p>
