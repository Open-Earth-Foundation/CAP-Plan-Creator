## Main Action Description: 
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses
**City:** Caxias do Sul

### 1. National Climate Strategy
Brazil's national climate strategy aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, focusing on cost-effective mitigation actions aligned with socio-economic development. The strategy includes sectoral plans for land use, forestry, and agriculture, emphasizing the suppression of illegal deforestation and sustainable agricultural practices. Brazil's commitment to climate neutrality by 2050 is supported by scientific methodologies and data, with a focus on just transitions and addressing social inequalities. The strategy also involves promoting climate justice and valuing traditional knowledge [source: Brazil_NDC_November2024.pdf, pages 6, 7, 14, 22].
