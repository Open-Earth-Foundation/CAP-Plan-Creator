## Main Action Description: 
Climate action: Disaster early warning  
City: Camaçari

### 1. Broad Climate Strategy
Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes a holistic approach to climate change, integrating adaptation and mitigation efforts through the National Climate Plan. This plan includes the National Adaptation Strategy, which aims to enhance resilience against climate impacts, particularly in urban areas, and is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [source: Brazil NDC, page 6]. At the state level, Bahia's climate strategy focuses on sustainable urban development and disaster risk management, recognizing the importance of local actions in achieving national targets [source: Brazil NDC, page 11]. Camaçari, as part of Bahia, is encouraged to develop specific climate action plans that address local vulnerabilities and promote community engagement [source: World Bank Green Cities, page 46].

### 2. Climate Action Description
The "Disaster Early Warning" action in Camaçari aims to establish and maintain early warning systems for climate-related disasters, including heatwaves and droughts. This initiative will involve the implementation of Heat Action Plans (HAPs) that incorporate nature-based solutions, public awareness campaigns, and targeted measures for vulnerable populations. Key performance indicators will include reductions in heatwave-related mortality and increased public awareness. The action is expected to enhance community resilience, improve public health, and reduce economic losses from climate impacts, with a timeline for implementation of less than five years [source: Brazil NDC, page 12].
