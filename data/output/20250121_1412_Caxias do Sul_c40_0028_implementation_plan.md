## Main Action Description: 
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses
**City:** Caxias do Sul

### 1. National Climate Strategy
Brazil's national climate strategy aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, focusing on optimizing resource allocation to maximize mitigation results while promoting socio-economic development. The strategy includes sectoral plans for land use, forestry, and transportation, emphasizing the reduction of emissions and the promotion of sustainable practices. Brazil's commitment to climate neutrality by 2050 is supported by scientific methodologies and data, aligning with the country's Climate Plan and the Paris Agreement goals [source: Brazil_NDC_November2024.pdf, pages 6-7].
