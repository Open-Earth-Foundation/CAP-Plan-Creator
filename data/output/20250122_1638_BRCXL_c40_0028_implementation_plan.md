# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses<br>
**City:** Caxias do Sul

## Main Action Description
### 1. Climate Strategy Overview
Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with sectoral plans for mitigation and adaptation. The strategy includes optimizing resource allocation to maximize mitigation results while supporting socio-economic development. It also highlights the importance of integrating climate and digital transitions to leverage green technologies [source: Brazil_NDC_November2024.pdf, pages 7, 9, 14]. However, specific national strategies for Zero Emission Buses were not found. Local strategies for Caxias do Sul regarding Zero Emission Buses were also not available.
