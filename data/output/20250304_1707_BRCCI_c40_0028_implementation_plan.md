# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Camaçari<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Camaçari, located in the state of Bahia, Brazil, is a vibrant city with a population of approximately 300,372 residents. Situated in a tropical rainforest biome, the city faces significant socio-economic challenges, including a very high percentage of low-income residents. The city is characterized by a high population density and a substantial contribution to Brazil's industrial emissions, making it a critical area for climate action.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to integrate electric or other zero-emission technologies into Camaçari's public transportation fleet. This action is crucial for reducing the city's transportation emissions, which currently stand at 295,693,000 metric tons. By transitioning to zero-emission buses, Camaçari can significantly improve air quality, promote equity by providing cleaner air to underserved communities, and create job opportunities in the maintenance and operation of these new technologies. The initiative also aligns with the city's need to enhance public transportation accessibility for low-income individuals.

Nationally, Brazil's climate strategy emphasizes the transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, with a strong focus on electrification and the use of biofuels in the transportation sector. The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative in Camaçari aligns with Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable urban development and improved public transport systems [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 15]. This initiative supports Brazil's broader goals of reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting low-carbon technological innovations [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 19].

## Subactions:

1. **Set a Target Year for Transition**: Establish a clear target year for transitioning to zero-emission buses to drive action and signal demand to suppliers and capital providers. This will encourage investment in developing zero-emission bus models and technology [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

2. **Conduct Feasibility Studies**: Perform in-depth feasibility studies to explore technology and financing options. This should include an analysis of the current fleet, potential routes, and the necessary infrastructure upgrades [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

3. **Engage Stakeholders**: Collaborate with utility companies, bus manufacturers, and other stakeholders to ensure a coordinated approach to electrification. This includes negotiating with suppliers and fleet operators [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

4. **Pilot Program Implementation**: Initiate a pilot program to test the deployment of electric buses. This will help identify potential challenges and refine the implementation strategy [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 0].

5. **Procurement of Zero-Emission Buses**: Begin the procurement process for zero-emission buses, ensuring that all new buses purchased are electric or zero-emission [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 0].

6. **Develop Charging Infrastructure**: Establish charging infrastructure, including both depot and on-route charging options. Consider the use of fast or super-fast charging technology to extend the range of buses and ensure flexibility in route coverage [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 8].

7. **Training and Workforce Development**: Provide training for drivers and maintenance staff to ensure they are equipped to operate and maintain the new technologies effectively [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

8. **Monitor and Evaluate Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of the zero-emission buses and the supporting infrastructure. Use key performance indicators such as reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and operational cost savings to evaluate success [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

9. **Public Engagement and Awareness**: Promote public acceptance and demand for cleaner public transportation options through awareness campaigns and community engagement initiatives [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

10. **Policy and Regulatory Support**: Work with government bodies to ensure supportive policies and regulations are in place to promote zero-emission transportation and provide financial incentives for transit agencies [source: zero_emission_buses_c40.pdf, page 1].

## Municipal Institutions Involved:

## Climate Risks:

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative primarily focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality through the integration of electric and zero-emission technologies in public transportation. It does not directly address the city's listed climate risks such as droughts, heatwaves, floods, sea-level rise, landslides, storms, wildfires, or diseases. Therefore, the primary goal of this initiative is to mitigate emissions rather than adapt to specific climate risks.

## Mitigation Sectors:

* Transportation: This climate action primarily addresses the Transportation sector by integrating zero-emission technologies, such as electric buses, into Camaçari's public transportation fleet. This initiative will significantly reduce transportation emissions, which are a major contributor to the city's total emissions, amounting to 295,693,000 metric tons. By transitioning to zero-emission buses, the initiative aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote more sustainable urban transit solutions.
