# Climate Action Implementation Plan
**City:** Caxias do Sul<br>
**Climate action:** Zero Emission Buses

Caxias do Sul, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, is a vibrant city with a population of approximately 463,501 residents. Nestled in a tropical rainforest biome, the city spans an area of 1,643 square kilometers and sits at an elevation of 817 meters. Despite its rich natural surroundings, Caxias do Sul faces significant challenges related to transportation emissions, which contribute substantially to its total greenhouse gas emissions.

The "Zero Emission Buses" initiative aims to transform the city's public transportation system by integrating electric or other zero-emission technologies into its bus fleet. This action is crucial for Caxias do Sul, as it targets a reduction in transportation emissions by 20-39%, thereby improving air quality and promoting sustainable urban transit. The initiative also emphasizes equity and inclusion by providing cleaner air and reliable public transportation options for low-income and underserved communities.

This climate action aligns with Brazil's national climate strategy, which emphasizes the transition to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy by 2050. Brazil's National Mitigation Strategy, as part of its Climate Plan, seeks to optimize resource allocation for maximum mitigation results while supporting socio-economic development [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 7]. The Zero Emission Buses initiative contributes to this strategy by prioritizing mitigation measures with co-benefits for adaptation and resilience, aligning with Brazil's commitment to sustainable development and climate justice [source: Brazil_NDC_November_2024.pdf, page 14].

## Subactions:

1. **Set a Target Year for Transition**: Establish a clear target year for the complete transition to zero-emission buses. This will help signal demand to bus suppliers and capital providers, encouraging investment in zero-emission bus models and technology [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 1].

2. **Conduct Feasibility Studies**: Perform in-depth feasibility studies to explore technology and financing options. This should include assessments of the current bus fleet, potential zero-emission technologies, and financial models for procurement [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 1].

3. **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve key stakeholders such as utility companies, bus manufacturers, and transit operators early in the process. This engagement is crucial for negotiating procurement options and ensuring the availability of necessary technologies [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 1].

4. **Pilot Zero-Emission Buses**: Implement a pilot program to test zero-emission buses in real-world conditions. This will help identify operational challenges and gather data on performance and user satisfaction [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 1].

5. **Procure Zero-Emission Buses**: Explore various procurement options such as outright purchase, leasing, or joint purchasing agreements. Early engagement with manufacturers is recommended to ensure product availability and to understand the range of technologies available [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 2].

6. **Develop Charging Infrastructure**: Invest in the necessary charging infrastructure for electric buses. This includes planning for overnight charging facilities and exploring on-route charging options if applicable [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 1].

7. **Train Workforce**: Provide training for drivers and maintenance staff on the operation and upkeep of zero-emission buses. This is essential for ensuring the smooth operation and longevity of the new fleet [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 1].

8. **Staggered Introduction of Buses**: Gradually introduce zero-emission buses into the fleet to allow for adjustments and improvements based on initial performance data. This phased approach helps manage costs and operational changes [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 1].

9. **Monitor and Evaluate Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of zero-emission buses and the supporting infrastructure. Use key performance indicators such as reduction in emissions, operational cost savings, and user satisfaction to evaluate success and make necessary adjustments [source: C40 Zero Emission Buses, page 1].
