## Main Action Description: 
**Climate action:** Disaster early warning
**City:** Camaçari

### 1. National Climate Strategy
Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes the importance of sub-national entities in achieving climate goals, with a focus on adaptation and risk reduction. The strategy includes the development of sectoral plans for adaptation, such as risk and disaster management, which are crucial for implementing early warning systems. These plans aim to increase resilience, promote sustainable development, and ensure climate justice by addressing vulnerabilities across various sectors and communities [source: Brazil_NDC_November2024.pdf, pages 10-12].

### 2. Climate Action Description
In Camaçari, the disaster early warning system focuses on mitigating risks from heatwaves, droughts, and storms. This involves establishing timely information dissemination channels and implementing Heat Action Plans (HAPs) with nature-based solutions. The initiative aims to enhance public health, safety, and community resilience, while promoting equity by targeting vulnerable groups and engaging marginalized communities in planning [source: Climate Action Data].
