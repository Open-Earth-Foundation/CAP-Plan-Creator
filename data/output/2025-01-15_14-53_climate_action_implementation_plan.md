## Main Action Description: 
Climate action: Disaster early warning  
City: Camaçari

### 1. Broad Climate Strategy
Brazil's national climate strategy emphasizes "climate justice," addressing social inequalities while promoting human rights, particularly for vulnerable groups. The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) aim for net-zero emissions by 2050, with specific targets for 2035, focusing on adaptation and mitigation through participatory approaches at all government levels [source: Brazil NDC, pages 6, 22]. Bahia's state strategy aligns with these goals, emphasizing sustainable development and community engagement in climate action [source: Brazil NDC, page 10]. Camaçari's local strategy will incorporate these frameworks, focusing on enhancing resilience to climate-related hazards through community-based initiatives.

### 2. Climate Action Description
The "Disaster Early Warning" action in Camaçari aims to establish robust early warning systems for heatwaves, droughts, and storms. This includes the implementation of Heat Action Plans (HAPs) that integrate urban planning with nature-based solutions, public awareness campaigns, and targeted support for vulnerable populations. Key performance indicators will measure the reduction in heatwave-related mortality, the timeliness of warnings, and community engagement levels. The action will require coordination among emergency services, investment in urban planning, and technological infrastructure, with a timeline for implementation of less than five years [source: Brazil NDC, page 11].
